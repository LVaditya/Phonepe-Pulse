# Phonepe-Pulse
The project focuses on developing an interactive dashboard which facilitates the accsess to data provided by the Phone-Pe. Phone-pe is a big platform that provides easy money transaction.
The founders of this company found it really difficult to collect necessary data during the initial stage of establishment. They made a promise to make the data they collected public so that it could help young 
entreprenuers in their future establishment. 
Here I used python programming to come up with a dashboard that can provide an easy user interface that provide the data with good visualization and necessary filters to drill down into details as per the requirement.
The tools used here are :
1. Python
2. SQL
3. Streamlit

The base of the program is python. I used colab Notebook for the same. The data was pulled from the github account of the phone pulse group. The data pulled from this was stored in SQL. SQL queries are used to get
necessary data from the SQL. I used SQLlite for data storage here. The dashboard is developed using Streamlit application. Streamlit provides a wide variety of input options like multiselect options , radio selection, 
filters, and other interactive mechanism for easy user inputs.
